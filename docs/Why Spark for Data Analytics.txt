Why Spark for Data Analytics?

Spark is a powerful analytics engine that can be used for large-scale data processing.

The most important reasons for using Spark are:


- Spark is simple, powerful, and fast.

- Spark is free and open source.

- Spark runs everywhere (Hadoop, Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud).

- Spark can read/write data from/to any data source (Amazon S3, Hadoop HDFS, relational databases, etc.).

- Spark can be integrated with almost any data application.

- Spark can read/write data in row-based (such as Avro) and column-based (such as Parquet and ORC) formats.

- Spark has a rich but simple set of APIs for all kinds of ETL processes.



Spark is fast. 
Spark is up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce for large-scale data processing.
